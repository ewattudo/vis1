        "#Admission Data 2024\n",
        "**Project Overview:**\n",
        "This notebook is a visualization of our current status admitting students at Rutgers Camden Graduate School. Specifically, where we're currently at, how we should approach our decisions, and think about how we could improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Future-Oriented Analysis**\n",
        "Remember: it is widely understood that retaining existing customers is less costly than aquiring new ones. The aim is to be intelligent when targetting our outreach.\n",
        "- Targetting **current** students\n",
        "- Identifying Majors with irregular/proper numbers\n",
        "- For programs with high rejection rates, evaluate whether they are too selective. If so, consider revising admission criteria.\n",
        "- Discovering New Locations with Admitted Students\n",
        "-  Identify emerging regions where new marketing efforts could yield success.\n",
        "- Finding Ratio of Majors who have a \"Complete Application\", \"Admitted\", \"Deferred\", and targetting individuals in those areas\n",
        "- Not targetting Majors who accept only a select few indiividuals, don't complete their applications, have **extremely high** # of applications or **extremely** low # of applications\n",
        "\n",
        "**Past Data Analysis:**\n",
        "The data includes three key variables: country of origin, concentration of applicants, and the percentage of those who committed to attending as a proportion of total applications. Numbers and locations are relatively the same as last year's despite a couple of switch ups like some students in Japan now rather than Europe.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Based on the data, India has a higher number of applications than the US. This suggests that a well-planned campaign in India could yield strong results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Findings:**\n",
        "- Computer Science and Data Science (MS) seem to be the two most popular programs in terms of the number of applications.\n",
        "- These two programs are taking up larger segments of the chart compared to others like Biology (MS) and other smaller programs.\n",
        "Computer Science and Data Science (MS) show a full range of application statuses from Started, Submitted, Complete, Denied, and Admit-Coming.\n",
        "- For each program, the majority of applications seem to be in the Submitted and Started stages, indicating a high number of applicants still in progress.\n",
        "- These programs show similar application statuses. Some stages like Denied and Admit-Coming are less prominent, likely due to fewer total applicants.\n",
        "- Large number of applicants from India - to a point suprassing US. Moderate #s from America, Solid #s coming from Africa\n",
        "- Similar #s coming in Fall and Spring Map Data.\n",
        "**Limitations**\n",
        "1. The locations data has some inaccurate data due to individuals having incomplete applications, inaccurate data inputting, etc.\n",
        "2.  Undergraduate Data: The data on undergraduate students is insufficient for drawing broad, nomothetic conclusions.\n",
        "3. Amount of data: With more data to work with, it would allow me to get more in depth and exploratory. For instance, demographics, scholarship, $ Marketted to specific countries, etc.\n",
        "**Future Directions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Prediction Data Using Data over the Years\n",
        "- Focusing Marketing in US & Africa, Moderate #s in India\n",
        "Improving the Application Completion Process:\n",
        "-Personalized email campaigns and social media ads targeting students at the Submitted stage for more complete applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Focus on simplifying and streamlining the application process. Many applications started but not completed. Missed opprotunity for conversions.\n",
